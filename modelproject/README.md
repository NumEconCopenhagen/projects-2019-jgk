# Modelproject

This project has to purpose to find the optimal consumption, for a given consumer. We are given an utility function and the price of the two goods.
This project is greatly inspired by the 2016 exam Winter in Microeconomics 1.
The optimal consumption for the consumer is determined both numerically, and algebraically.

The results of this project can be seen in the modelproject.ipynb file, where all the required plots are defined in the beginnning of the project.
