# Dataproject

The primary purpose of this project will be looking at Egypt's GDP and unemployment rate. It will be researched whether or not a higher GDP does in fact lead to a lower rate of unemployment, cf. Okun's Law, and comment on why/why not. This is finding the correlation between the two gonna make possible, and is therefore the primary goal of the project. The correlation will in addition be discussed, and commented on. GDP data is acquired from World Bank using the wb function, and data for the unemployment rates is implemented through an excel document, which is downloaded from the World Bank site. The period up for investigation is 1991-2014, and the development in each of the two will be examined seperately, to then be correlated and investigated using regression.

Worth metioning; Since the data in this project is downloaded, the webdata extension is required, in addition to matplotlib_venn, in order to run this code.

The project is composed of 2 parts, 

  1 - Gathering and implementation of data
  
  2 - Analyzing and processing the data
