The answers to this project is implemented in the examproject.ipynb file.

In the first problem, an utility optimization problem is given, along with a model of labour as a function of human capital.
This is given in a two-period scenario. The purpose is to solve the model, and visualize the results.
This is done by, well, solving the model, illustrating given break points, and presenting the results illustrative in form of graphs and an interactive floatslide. 

In the second problem, an AS-AD model is given, with purpose of finding the optimal inflation rate, and the optimal output rate. The majority of the questions are answered, under assumptions of the given shocks, paramter values and starting points. I do however struggle with the last 2 questions of this problem.

The third problem presents us with an economy that consists of 50.000 consumers, and 3 given goods. The walras equilibrium is found by using the tatonnement metthod, which is plotted along the way. Thereafter the same situation is glanced upon once more, where the endowments however are equal, to a change in the equilibrium prices.
